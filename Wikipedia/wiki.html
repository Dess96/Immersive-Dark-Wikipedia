                    <p>
                        <span class="bold-text">HTML5</span> is a <a href="#">markup language</a> used for structuring and presenting content on the <a href="#">World Wide Web</a>. It is the fifth and 
                        latest major version of <a href="#">HTML</a> that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is 
                        known as the <a href="#">HTML Living Standard</a> and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, 
                        Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

                        HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" 
                        status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other 
                        new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices 
                        such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain <a href="#">backward-compatible</a> with older software. 
                        HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]

                        HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and 
                        rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and <a href="#">application programming interfaces</a> (APIs) 
                        for complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, 
                        because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many new <a href="#">syntactic</a> features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new 
                        video, audio and canvas elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML 
                        for mathematical formulas was also added. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements 
                        such as main, section, article, header, footer, aside, nav, and figure are added. New attributes 
                        were introduced, some elements and attributes were removed, and others such as a, cite, and menu were changed,
                        redefined, or standardized. The APIs and <a href="#">Document Object Model</a> (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 
                        specification,[6] and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.[7]

                        The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, 
                        HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[8] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments 
                        on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.[9]
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software presented a position paper at a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) workshop in 
                        June 2004,[10] focusing on developing technologies that are backward-compatible with existing browsers,[11] including 
                        an initial draft specification of Web Forms 2.0. The workshop concluded with a vote—8 for, 14 against—for continuing 
                        work on HTML.[12] Immediately after the workshop, WHATWG was formed to start work based upon that position paper, and a 
                        second draft, Web Applications 1.0, was also announced.[13] The two specifications were later merged to form HTML5.[14] 
                        The HTML5 specification was adopted as the starting point of the work of the new HTML working group of the W3C in 2007.

                        Main article: <a href="#">Thoughts on Flash</a>
                        <p>
                            While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two technologies are very different. Both include 
                            features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using Scalable Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 on its 
                            own cannot be used for animation or interactivity – it must be supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many 
                            Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML5 (see Comparison of HTML5 and Flash). HTML5's interactive 
                            capabilities became a topic of mainstream media attention around April 2010[15][16][17][18] after Apple Inc.'s then-CEO
                            Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled "Thoughts on Flash" in which he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary
                            to watch video or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era, such as
                            HTML5, will win".[19] This sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that, while HTML5 provides enhanced
                            functionality, developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other 
                            functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash.[20] In early November 2011, Adobe announced that it would discontinue 
                            development of Flash for mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5.[21] On 25 July 2017, Adobe 
                            announced that both the distribution and support of Flash will cease by the end of 2020.[22]

                        <h3>Last call, candidacy, and recommendation stages</h3>
                        <p>
                            On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 
                            2011, the working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to communities inside and outside W3C to confirm
                            the technical soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive test suite to achieve broad 
                            interoperability for the full specification by 2014, which was the target date for recommendation.[23] In January
                            2011, the WHATWG renamed its "HTML5" specification HTML Living Standard. The W3C nevertheless continued its project 
                            to release HTML5.[24]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing
                            on a single definitive standard, which is considered as a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization continues its work 
                            with HTML5 as a "living standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being 
                            updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.[25]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate Recommendation.[26] The criterion for advancement to W3C 
                            Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable implementations".[27]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On 16 September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.[28] On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a W3C 
                            Recommendation,[29] bringing the specification process to completion.[2] On 1 November 2016, HTML 5.1 was released as a 
                            W3C Recommendation.[30] On 14 December 2017, HTML 5.2 was released as a W3C Recommendation.[31]

                        <h3>W3C and WHATWG conflict</h3>
                        <p>
                            The "Introduction" section in the WHATWG spec (edited by Ian "Hixie" Hickson) is critical of W3C, e.g. "Note: Although 
                            we have asked them to stop doing so, the W3C also republishes some parts of this specification as separate documents." 
                            In its "History" subsection it portrays W3C as resistant to Hickson's and WHATWG's original HTML 5 plans, then jumping 
                            on the bandwagon belatedly (though Hickson was in control of the W3C HTML 5 spec, too). Regardless, it indicates a major
                            philosophical divide between the organizations:[42]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <blockquote>For a number of years, both groups then worked together. In 2011, however, the groups came to the conclusion that
                                they had different goals: the W3C wanted to publish a "finished" version of "HTML5", while the WHATWG wanted to continue
                                working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification rather than freezing it in a state with 
                                known problems, and adding new features as needed to evolve the platform.
                                Since then, the WHATWG has been working on this specification (amongst others), and the W3C has been copying fixes 
                                made by the WHATWG into their fork of the document (which also has other changes).

                        The W3C proposed a greater reliance on modularity as a key part of the plan to make faster progress, meaning identifying
                        specific features, either proposed or already existing in the spec, and advancing them as separate specifications. Some 
                        technologies that were originally defined in HTML 5 itself are now defined in separate specifications:

                            The HTML 5 syntax is no longer based on SGML[85][86] despite the similarity of its markup. It has, however, been 
                            designed to be backward-compatible with common parsing of older versions of HTML. It comes with a new introductory 
                            line that looks like an SGML document type declaration, !DOCTYPE html, which triggers the standards-compliant 
                            rendering mode.[87] Since 5 January 2009, HTML 5 also includes Web Forms 2.0, a previously separate WHATWG 
                            specification.[88][89]

                            In addition to specifying markup, HTML 5 specifies scripting application programming interfaces (APIs) that can be 
                            used with JavaScript.[91] Existing Document Object Model (DOM) interfaces are extended and de facto features 
                            documented. There are also new APIs, such as: 
                            <ul>

                            Not all of the above technologies are included in the W3C HTML 5 specification, though 
                            they are in the WHATWG HTML specification.[103] Some related technologies, which are not 
                            part of either the W3C HTML 5 or the WHATWG HTML specification, are as follows. The W3C 
                            publishes specifications for these separately:

                                <li>IndexedDB – an indexed hierarchical key-value store (formerly WebSimpleDB);[104]</li>
                                <li>File[105] – an API intended to handle file uploads and file manipulation;[106]</li>
                                <li>Directories and System – an API intended to satisfy client-side-storage use cases not well served by databases;[107]</li>
                                <li>File Writer – an API for writing to files from web applications;[108]</li>

                            HTML 5 cannot provide animation within web pages. Additional JavaScript or CSS3 is 
                            necessary for animating HTML elements. Animation is also possible using JavaScript and 
                            HTML 4[114][failed verification], and within SVG elements through SMIL, although browser 
                            support of the latter remains uneven as of 2011.
